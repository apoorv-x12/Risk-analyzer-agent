i have just 1 day, let's create this Understood—let’s restore the three-icon scheme. Now:

✅ Plug-and-Play: You can wire this up straight away with minimal learning.

⚙️ LLM-Scaffoldable with Some Learning: You can get starter code via ChatGPT, but you’ll need to tweak, configure, and understand the patterns.

❌ Deep Research & Engineering: Requires substantial custom design, data collection, or model training.


Node

Category

Why

LoadDocument

✅

Standard parser libraries (pdfplumber, PyMuPDF)—just install and call.

ParseClauses

❌

No single parsing rule; you’ll build or fine-tune logic (regex/LLM) for hierarchy detection.

ChunkClauses

⚙️

LangChain/Haystack templates exist; LLM can draft sliding-window or semantic-split code, but you’ll customize.

EmbedChunks

❌

Embedding model choice, scale/quantization, and fine-tuning go beyond a quick prompt.

RetrieveEvidence

⚙️

Boilerplate hybrid search (BM25 + vectors) can be scaffolded by LLM, though you’ll need to set thresholds.

ClassifyRisk

❌

Fine-tuning Legal-BERT or calibrating few-shot prompts is substantial work.

ExplainRisk

⚙️

LLM can generate explanation prompts and formatting, but you’ll iterate on prompt design for faithfulness.

AggregateRisks

✅

Simple weighted-average or threshold logic—straightforward code.

GenerateReport

✅

Templating in Markdown/HTML/JSON—ChatGPT can scaffold this fully.

Legend

✅ Plug-and-Play: Minimal learning curve; code works out of the box.

⚙️ LLM-Scaffoldable with Some Learning: You can get starter code from ChatGPT, but you’ll need to understand and adjust it.

❌ Deep Research & Engineering: Involves substantial custom design, experimentation, or data work.
